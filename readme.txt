[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
Evidentally, some ftp clients, which shall rename nameless (*cough*cough* FileZilla), doesn't transfer files without an extension correctly without some work.  After looking at this thread, I wondered how hard it would be to add an extension to the filenames that attachments are stored under.  So I did some research and figured out it wasn't hard at all.....

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]What It Does[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod makes a small change to Subs.php to add the ".321" extension to all attachment filenames.  It also renames all attachments to have the ".321" extension.  Upon uninstalling, it removes the ".321" extension.  This mod also modified the code for the PM attachments mod, if present, in order to effect the same modification to it.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There are no admin settings.  To disable it, you must remove this mod.
